# StreamFairs Documentation

### Goal:
My goal is to build an enterprise-level software solo allowing me to cover every area from the backend to the front end. I have  challenged myself to be done by the 1st of October 2023. 

Project Features:
- User registration and authentication.
- Event creation and management.
- Live streaming capabilities.
- Interactive attendee engagement tools (e.g., chat, polls, Q&A).
- Analytics and reporting.
- Sponsorship and exhibitor options.
- Networking features.
- Integration capabilities with other software or platforms.
