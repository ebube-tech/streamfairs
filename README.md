# StreamFairs Documentation

### Goal:
My goal is to build an enterprise-level software solo allowing me to cover every area from the backend to the front end. I have  challenged myself to be done by the 1st of October 2023. 

Project Features:
- User registration and authentication.
- Event creation and management.
- Live streaming capabilities.
- Interactive attendee engagement tools (e.g., chat, polls, Q&A).
- Analytics and reporting.
- Sponsorship and exhibitor options.
- Networking features.
- Integration capabilities with other software or platforms.

## My Development Documentation Log

### 26/09/23
19:00: As it will be a solo project, I used Chatgpt to generate a breakdown of the flow of task from planning to post launch to save my time and augment for the lack of a team on this project. Full breakdown is available here:- [Project Objective and Requirements](https://github.com/ebube-tech/streamfairs/blob/main/Clear%20Objectives%20and%20Requirements.md)

19:30 pm: I started this project by deciding the name of this software would be "Streamfairs" and creating the Repo on Github. 

21: 00 pm: 
I set up the development environments and servers.
Configure cloud infrastructure (if not already in place).

22:00 pm: Setup user registration and login.

23:00 pm: Implement user profile creation and customization.
